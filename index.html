Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3> Method 1: You have to find a Coping Mechanism</h3>
              <p> In order to manage your emotions, you need to understand them and the 1st step of doing that is understanding what emational needs you have. Take time some time and figure what are the emotional needs that are most important to you. This could be feeling in control or feeling respected,or feeling comfortable. Lots of times if your brain feels like these things are not being met, then it can cause a negative feeling. </p>

              <h3>Figure out what triggers you</h3>
              <p> Next you have to figure out what triggers you in your daily life. We're consistently experiencing differnt emotions each day. When your brain feels like it's lacking something it needs,common emotions that come is saddness, anger, or fear. Use what you learned earlier about your emotions and what you feel are most imortant to you and this will help you understand your triggers and why the thing is triggering you. An example of this is maybe your significant other disrespects you and that causes you to get angery. Another example could be experiencing anger in traffic. The trigger could be the traffic but the real reason you're triggered is because you feel lack of control. </p>

              <h3>Shift Your Focus</h3>
              <p> The positive thing about knowing what triggers you, you know how to combat it now! Use this knowledge to your advantage. Once you figured out why you get triggered and what triggers you, you can shift your focus away from that negative feeling. Thinking of something positve or shift your attention from the thing or person that has upsetted you. Do this by maybe listening to music that you love or an activity you like doing. If that doesn't work, find a way to seperate yourself from the situation.</p>

              <h3>Find mental calmness</h3>
              <p>Sometimes trying to divert your attention to something else or thinking about something positive doesn't work, especially when your emotions become very heightend in a situation. This can be problematic in a social setting, esspecially in a work setting. If you find yourselfin a situation like this, before doing a harsh action, seperate yourself and find a way to take a few deep breathes and focus on them. This won't just redirect your focus but it will help you physically and mentally calm down. Do this repetively for doing something repetitivly can calm your nerves. Walking or any other thing that you can do with rhythm can do this.  </p>

              <h3>Find ways to make positive changes</h3>
              <p> This takes time, trial and error so you got to be patient with yourself. But once you figure your emotions out more and more, you can try other ways to go at your negative emotions. Find ways to react differently than you usually do. Change your environment if you can. Consistent exercising can help relief lots of stress as well and help regulate your emotions. What you're eating can affect the way you act so maybe if you're in a bad mood or expressing a negative emotion, especially for a long time period, figure out how you can change or motify your diet. Or just eat something in general! Being hangry is a real thing! To help youself keep track of this kind of stuff, keep a journal and write your experiences or stresses down. This will overall help you figure out what works and what doesn't work.</p>

              <h3> Fully Understanding Your Emotions</h3>
              <p> Lastly, to fully understand your emotions, you have to akknowledge them and not just shove them away. When you feel something ask yourself why you are feeling them and don't ignore them.Reflecting on your emotions are really important. You can do this by finding a support system for this is hard to do by yourself. This can be simply with friends and family that you trust. Talking about your stresses is a good thing and doing it with people who truly support you makes it a lot easier for you to go through it. If need be if you're really struggling consider getting counseling. Most importantly find ways to practice self care.Self care is just fully making sure all your needs are met. Allow yourself to do the things you enjoy and be around the people you love! Even if you're busy, breaks are vital for your mental health.</p>
